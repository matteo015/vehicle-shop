# First Instance.

This is the first VEHICLE SHOP project commit.

Thoughts:

Well, i'm a bit directionless with the version naming, overall project architecture/folder structure and well... developing a software in general.

The main ideia is to perform simple CRUD operations via an interface.

For now on, everything may change including the identity of the project itself.

The end goal is to have a full blow desktop app with a website that sends requests to fetch data and a admin side that manipulates data.
## Learned.

So far, i got myself accustomed to some basic principles of OOP programing and basic business logic. Working with menu loops and interactions was fun but a bit confusing.

Organizing folders/code and working out the dependency injection stuff proved to be challenging

Summary:

* Dependency Injection
* Inheritance
* Interfaces
* Method generalization.
* CRUD
* MVC folder structure



## Project and Tech

This version interacts with the user using exclusively the console, any CRUD operations will reset when the app is closed. Databases are not included yet.

Right now i plan to use only the .NET enviroment, but of course, i may change my mind in the future
## Future Updates

I will use this section as a note to my future self to remember what i want to add and have work on.

Main Objectives:

* Refactor obfuscated code
* Refactor business logic
* Improve folder structure
* Improve error handling
* Introduce Error logs
* Work on Login interfaces
* Data validation

Long run Objectives:

* Start working with a proper GUI
* Introduce Async methods
* Start working with databases (probably MYSQL)
